										<p1> WORK EXPERIENCE

2015 - 2016 Medical Affairs Industrial Trainee, Pfizer, Surrey
•	Co-developed a medical education website with the digital team based upon insights from Healthcare Professionals gathered from social listening exercises, questionnaires, workshops and advisory boards. 
•	Collaboratively supported the launch and subsequent development of an internal communications campaign to highlight the breadth of Pfizer’s portfolio and the value that its medicines bring to patients. 
•	As UK manager for Investigator-Initiated Research projects, I handled submissions for, and monitored the progress of, external research projects through Pfizer’s INSPIIRE programme
•	First point of contact for the provision of Pfizer’s off-license medicines on a named-patient basis. This involved reviewing medicine requests, communicating with Healthcare Professionals, coordinating logistical arrangements and producing regular reports.
•	Utilising principles of the Lean Six Sigma improvement method and working cross-functionally with colleagues across the business, I successfully enhanced the efficiency of the process for providing off-license medicines. Key outcomes: medicines were delivered to patients sooner; the number of customer complaints decreased; fewer back and forth communications between colleagues.
•	Project managed a compliance-upskilling initiative to educate colleagues about applications of the ABPI Code of Practice and recent PMCPA case studies. Raised awareness of the project through delivering presentations to local and global colleagues.

•	Academically supported two students with their GCSE Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry studies.

Summer 2014 Activities Instructor, First Choice, Holiday Village Kos

2012 - 2013 Waitress, The Dressers Arms, Lancashire
•	Provided exceptional customer service in an often-pressurised working environment. 

2011 – 2013 Sales Assistant, Maidens Ladieswear, Lancashire
•	Accurately monitored stock levels and dealt with customer queries by telephone, email and in person.
