					<h3>Education</h3>
				
					Whilst majoring in Pharmacology, I have studied core science modules including Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics. For my dissertation, I am looking into the effects of diet and lifestyle on the progression of cancer. This year, I am broadening my academic experience by taking modules of Business Strategy and HR Management. My specifically tailored programme has enabled me to acquire a firm scientifc understanding as well as advance my problem solving and analytical skills.

					<h3>Work Experience</h3>
					MIDDLE Fantastic Adventures was an American pulp fantasy and science fiction magazine, edited by Ray Palmer and published from 1939 to 1953 by Ziff-Davis. It was almost cancelled at the end of 1940, but the October 1940 issue had unexpectedly good sales, helped by a strong cover (pictured) by J. Allen St. John for Robert Moore Williams' Jongor of Lost Land. Fantastic Adventures soon developed a reputation for light-hearted and whimsical stories. The cover art usually focused on melodramatic action scenes; H.W. McCauley's covers, featuring glamorous, alluring women, were among the most popular. In 1949 Palmer was replaced by Howard Browne, who was knowledgeable and enthusiastic about fantasy fiction.
